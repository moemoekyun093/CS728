Signs on the building say the restaurant has maintenance issues.\\nThe FSA states on its website that the local authority food safety officer will use a number of enforcement tools as well as giving advice and guidance to make sure these improvements are made.\\n“The food safety officer will also tell the business how quickly these improvements must be made and this will depend on the type of issue that needs to be addressed,” explains the FSA.\\n“The Food Hygiene Rating Scheme means that people can choose instead to eat out or buy food at places with higher ratings and businesses with low ratings are in danger of losing customers and so will be encouraged to improve standards more quickly and to maintain these in the future.\\n“If the officer finds that a business’s hygiene standards are very poor and there is an imminent risk to health – this means food is not safe to eat – the officer must take action to make sure that consumers are protected.

After Ovechkin's second-period goals, Washington never relinquished a two-goal lead. Four of the games in the series went to overtime.\\nThe Capitals will again move onto the conference semifinals after being eliminated by the Penguins in the second round in each of the past two seasons. The Penguins went on to win the Cup both times.\\n“I think we accomplished what we believed we could at the beginning of the series,” said Holtby, who relieved a struggling Philipp Grubauer in Game 2 and was great the rest of the way. “We'll enjoy it a bit, rest up and prepare for the next one.”\\nWashington coach Barry Trotz didn't want to talk about the Penguins yet.\\n“Please let me breathe,” he said. “We haven't taken a breath since this started.”\\nChandler Stephenson had a goal and an assist, and Dimitry Orlov, Devante Smith-Pelly and Lars Eller also tallied Monday for Washington, which never trailed in the game after prevailing in extra time in Game 5 on Saturday.

Oshie said. “It seems like we almost like it when an opposing team's crowd gets into it. It almost gets us going, too, and makes you want to quiet them down.”\\nThe story for the Blue Jackets in the four-game stretch was their power-play futility. After going 4 for 8 with a man advantage in the first two games, the Blue Jackets were 0 for 16 in the last four.\\n“Beginning of the series, our power play was going,” said Blue Jackets captain Nick Foligno, who scored twice Monday. “We were scoring at will. For whatever reason, it dried out. We've got to figure that out.”\\nPierre-Luc Dubois also scored, and Sergei Bobrovsky finished with 22 saves for the Blue Jackets, who lost in the first round of the playoffs for the second consecutive season and fourth time overall. They remain the only active NHL franchise never to win a playoff series.\\nThe Capitals struck first again Monday night.\\nShortly after Holtby held off a Columbus barrage, Orlov got his first goal of the series when he skated into the slot and rifled a slap shot over Bobrovsky's glove side with 7:48 left in the first.\\nFoligno got his first of the playoffs halfway through the second when he snapped a shot past Holtby from the right circle. That came soon after the Blue Jackets survived overlapping penalties, including 32 seconds of a 5-on-3.\\nOvechkin put back a rebound of a shot by Brooks Orpik to make it 2-1 with 7:10 left in the second, the 50th playoff goal of the Russian star's career. He then gave the Caps a two-goal lead with a one-timer from the left circle on a power play.\\nThe Blue Jackets tightened it to 3-2 early in the third when Dubois connected. But Smith-Pelly increased the Capitals' lead again 91 seconds later. Stevenson got a short-handed goal 1 1⁄ 2 minutes later to pad it.\\nFoligno got the Blue Jackets to 5-3 at 8:22 in the third, but Columbus couldn't get closer.
